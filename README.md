# `code-server-lkgr`

This repository builds [code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server)'s `web` branch based on their LKGR (Last Known Good Revision). 

## Getting the Releases

Releases are versioned as `lkgr-[VSCODE_VERSION]`. LKGR releases are kept built until the main tree
merges into another VSCode version.

Head over to releases and download the tarball. Keep in mind we're not building for MacOS and Windows at the moment.
